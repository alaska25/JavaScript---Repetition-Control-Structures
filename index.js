// console.log("Hello World");


//3. Create a variable number that will store the value of the number provided by the user via the prompt.

console.log("The number you provided is 100.");
let number = Number(prompt("Please provide a number"));
do {
	console.log("Do-while: " +number);
	// number++ //increament pusposes
	// number = number + 1; 
	number += 1;

	// loop will stop if the number is equal or greater than 10.
} while(number < 10);


// 4. Create a for loop that will be initialized with the number provided by the user, will stop when the value is less than or equal to 0 and will decrease by 1 every iteration.



// 5. Create a condition that if the current value is less than or equal to 50, stop the loop.


// 6. Create another condition that if the current value is divisible by 10, print a message that the number is being skipped and continue to the next iteration of the loop.



// 7. Create another condition that if the current value is divisible by 5, print the number


// 8. Create a variable that will contain the string supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.


// 9. Create another variable that will store the consonants from the string.


// 10. Create another for Loop that will iterate through the individual letters of the string based on itâ€™s length.

// 11. Create an if statement that will check if the letter of the string is equal to a vowel and continue to the next iteration of the loop if it is true.

// 12. Create an else statement that will add the letter to the second variable.
